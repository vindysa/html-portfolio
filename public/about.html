<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Vallen, a budding developer with a passion for learning all things computer science.  I'm a Warehouse Manager at kjdElectronics, and soon to be a Senior Tech Support Coordinator at PiShop.  While my eventual goal is currently to become a Data Scientist in order to utilize my degree is Biomedical Sciences, I am also deeply fascinated by automation, machine learning, and modern web design.</p>

<p>My first foray into programming was when I was 15 years old.  I was playing a game at the time that required the same tedious process over and over again of clicking on certain areas of the screen.  A few google searches later, I was writing a script in a completely foreign langauge to me called Python.  I didn't fully understand how it worked, but I realized then that a small amount of automation effort could save a lot of man hours if utilized on a larger scale.</p>

<p>While I still have a great deal to learn, it is the broad application of programming that excites me.  My entire life, I have always enjoyed learning new things and exporing new hobbies.  That is part of what I find so thrilling about programming.  There is always something new to learn.  There are always emerging techniques and framworks that allows you to code in new and exciting ways, and allows avenues that help deligate more tedious tasks to machines -- thus saving people valuble time both in business or even in their personal lives.</p>
