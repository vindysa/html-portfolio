<h1>The Best Movies According to Vallen</h1>
<h2>My top 3 personal favorite movies of all time.</h2>

<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>Easily my favorite movie.  It was my first real exposure to animation of that caliber, and the visuals alone were stunningly beautiful.  It set a new starndard for that genre of cinema.</p>
<h3>Ford vs. Ferrari</h3>
<p>Automobiles are near and dear to my heart.  Seeing the battle between these two coporations, and the struggles of two men to pioneer and develop was so fascinating to watch.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>I won't lie, I had to watch this movie more than once to figure out how many dreams within the dream they were going.  I enjoyed having to think about what I was watching for a change over just consuming the entertainment in front of me.</p>
